# wce_acm_hackatho
A Hackathon project with an aim to connect government, youths and manufacturing industries. Our project was not fully compleated before the timeline, but judges liked our idea and the app was serving it's purpose. Programming part of project was done by me and Samir Karemore. We plan to add further features to the project soon.
